# Welcome to uBot!
Hello,sro community.

Beforehand introducing my program and its features, i want to summarize the general use of it and point out why P-sro scene needs a program like this.

In the light of the recent p-sro servers we realized how the Auto-Events are important to bring huge amount of players since it provides a real-proper in game content-schedule and stuff. But then, you have to work tons of hours to for coding something like that.
At this point, i wanted to code an Event-Bot, aka uBot, which is going to make your life much more easier.
